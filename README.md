# RODMON64
RODMON64 is yet another machine language monitor/debugger for the Commodore 64 (C=64).  It began its life in 1985 on the VIC-20 as RODMON.  The original motivation was to create my own tool for writing assembly language programs when I did not have easy access to commercially available development tools. I initially wrote a rudimentary line assembler in BASIC, and used it to build enough of RODMON to use it to develop...itself!  What we have here today is the result of disassembling that old code and porting the ideas over to an assembly language implementation which is cross compiled on Microsoft Windows.  This power and convenience has resulted in a few more bells and whistles, and caused the image to grow beyond the 4K size I had originally intended.

Read the [manual](https://github.com/Dart-Matter/RODMON64/releases/download/20230517/MANUAL.html) for details.

I hope you find it useful or fun.
